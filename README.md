This is my final project. The project was created at the Java programming program in Osijek, which lasted for 5 months. I've been working on it for about 2.5 months.
The program is based on Java, Hibernet, MySql, and some APIs are added.

This program can:
-Unit / Delete / Change User (create a new account)
-Unit / Delete / Change Workplace
-Initiate / Delete / Change Workers
- Adding a worker to a job, adding a superior worker to a worker ...
- Search for a user with a name / account
- Possible Transaction Insight (which account, which user, which worker participated in the transaction), and can be automatically printed in the excell table
- It is also possible to search for transitions per worker, user and account (and print them in Excell)

If you are using the code, provide the link source source.
